##### This assignment relates to practice using the python matplotlib library.  This library allows the user to manipulate data and visualize the data with a variety of different charts.  This assignment uses a variety of bubble and pie charts to describe the driver and passenger data of a fictional ride sharing program called Pyber.

##### After creating the charts and analyzing the visualizations a number of conculsions can be drawn.

##### There is a variety ride share utilization by community type.  There are more rides provided in an urban setting vs. a rural setting.  This is most likely due to the density of riders.  Urban environments have a higher density of riders per distance.  
##### Related to the higher density of riders in the Urban environment would also lead to the tendancy of lower fairs.  Higher residential density would also correlate to lower ride distances travelled.  This would result in a lower average fair.
##### Additionally, rural environments account for a lower number of rides and cause an inverse correlation to the average fair.  It seems possible that the rural riders would be commuting to the city centers, perhaps for work or to facilitate transportation such as an airport. 
##### Driver count should be higher in the urban and suburban communities since there is a higher demand from more riders.  A higher driver count would be needed to support a larger population of drivers.
